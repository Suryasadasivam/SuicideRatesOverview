# Suicide Rates Overview Dataset Analysis

**Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the "Suicide Rates Overview" dataset using Python and statistical methods. The dataset consists of various variables related to suicide rates, including country, year, gender, age group, number of suicides, population, suicide rate per 100k population, country-year, HDI for year, GDP for year, GDP per capita, and generation. Our goal is to explore, analyze, and draw insights from this data.
